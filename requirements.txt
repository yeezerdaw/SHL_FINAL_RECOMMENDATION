# PyTorch (assuming CUDA compatible environment for GPU support)
# This will pull the appropriate CUDA-enabled version if the build environment supports it.
# If building in an environment without CUDA, it will typically fall back to a CPU version.
torch


# Utilities
python-dotenv # For loading .env files
pydantic # Used by FastAPI, but good to have explicitly for version control
requests # Good to have, might be used by Streamlit or if you add URL fetching
tqdm # For progress bars in scripts
# scikit-learn # Include if used in any final scripts/experiments (e.g., for TF-IDF, K-Means)
numpy # Often a dependency of scikit-learn, torch, rank_bm25
